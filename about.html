    <h1>Our Vision</h1>
    <p>
      We aim to create sustainable projects in an urban setting to assist vulnerable children and women. We envision a society where every person, in spite of the limitations of poverty, has equal opportunities to promote her well-being and achieve her aspirations. We are especially inclined to work with communities who are in need of urgent care and protection. We are dedicated to preserving the childhood of children and empowering women belonging to such communities.

    <p>
      We, at Aashray Society, are dedicated to the cause of creating sustainable projects in an urban setting which will assist vulnerable and underprivileged children and women in India. We aim to amplify the voice of every child and woman who is in urgent need of assistance. We aspire to bring joy through learning in their lives, particularly, through education, nutrition, life skills, health care and hygiene and through leisure/informative activities.

We also aim to generate awareness and consciousness about the benefits of education, healthcare and nutrition so that these are taken up as a choice and not under coercion/uninformed influence.

<h2>Our Focus</h2>

<div class="two-column">

  <!-- LEFT: TEXT -->
  <div>
    <p>
      Our special focus is on women and children from urban poor families, including poor migrants in Delhi NCR, since we believe that children and women are agents of change who utilize the assistance programming in highly sustainable ways. Moreover, the situation of urban poor migrants poses unique challenges which are exacerbated by the realities of the neo-liberal city life. They occupy a minimal space within a highly volatile informal job market which has grave effects especially on the development aspect of children and women. Thus, our current focus is on children and women from such communities in Noida.
